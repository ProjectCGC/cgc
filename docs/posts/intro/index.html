        <h2 id="who-are-we">Who Are We?</h2>
<p>ProjectCGC is a student-run game development studio on CSU Chico’s campus. First created by Courtney Cochran and myself, Arturo Armendaris-Ibarria. ProjectCGC’s goal is to help students develop skills for their resumes by learning to work in teams in a more casual environment in a longer-term game development cycle. This has been the goal from the very start. Although it’s gone through some rewrites over time, the goal has always been the same. To not only get our members into the industry by giving them experience but boost everyone involved into a better place. Whether that be socially or career wise, we wanted to help our members and fellow students get to where they want to be.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-we-get-here">How Did We Get Here?</h2>
<p>We sort of stumbled across the idea for ProjectCGC by accident. Courtney originally thought of what would become ProjectCGC, as a semester-long game jam. At the time she was president of the Computer Graphics Club and I was the Community Relations Officer. She expressed the idea in fall of 2023 of a way to create a place where students can do game jam games but for a longer term. When she asked,”Who wants to help me out?” I was the only one to eagerly say yes. Time passed and the idea was put on the back burner. Months later at the beginning of winter break 2023, Courtney contacted me asking if I was still interested in developing the idea further. We quickly drafted a brainstorming document and got to work. Eventually we realized we didn’t have a game jam anymore, we had a studio.</p>
<h2 id="newbie-pains">Newbie Pains</h2>
<p>ProjectCGC launched just one month later on February 9th 2024. At first, we were terrified. We didn’t know if anyone would show up to our first meeting but, when people kept coming in, we knew we&rsquo;d made something special. Courtney and I became executive producers and started running the project we made just a month before. We were lucky enough to have a group of very passionate game designers pitch a week later and we’ve been working on their game ever since.</p>
<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m proud of the community and the work that was created in ProjectCGC. Courtney and I work hard to create an environment where our members can not only thrive but get to where they want to be. Courtney graduated last semester (Spring 2024) but that hasn’t stopped her from working remotely to support our vision. I still have a few semesters left but hopefully what we built will live on at the school, even long after we graduate. Thank you to everyone who made this possible. Our members are the lifeblood of the project and we couldn’t have done it without them.</p>

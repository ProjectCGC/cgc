Project CGC is a small game development studio formed by California State University, Chico students in 2024. Our motivation is to create games that are fun, engaging, but most importantly, to foster an environment that encourages students to learn and grow as game developers. We are currently working on our first game, "Hypnotic/Biotic". Please check out our [projects](/projects) page for more information.
